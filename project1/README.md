# Project 1: Flask Book Review Site

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This site was created to practice using Python, Flask and a PostgreSQL database as a backend to a website. The front end is fairly simple yet still elegant as it was not the focus of this project. The site has a working login system, review & rating system and pulls API data from Goodreads.
