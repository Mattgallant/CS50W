# Project 1: Flask Book Review Site

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (2018)

This site was created to practice using Python, Flask and a PostgreSQL database as a backend to a website. The front end is fairly simple yet still elegant as it was not the focus of this project. The site has a working login system, review & rating system and pulls API data from Goodreads.

This was for CS50Web's old version of the course. This project was not submitted and I instead did project 1 of the new course. This one was done simply for practice.
